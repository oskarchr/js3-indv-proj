# EventFinder

**EventFinder** is an event management platform built with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**. It leverages an external API developed in a collaborative group project, which was focused on building a comprehensive backoffice system for event management. This API, accessible [here](https://github.com/chvlpont/event), supports essential features such as event creation, user booking, and attendance tracking. The backoffice system also includes administrator management, content customization via a CMS, and participant lists. **EventFinder** integrates these functionalities to provide a user-friendly interface for browsing, registering, and managing events.

## Features

- **Authentication:** Users can register and log in to access the platform. Authentication is integrated using the same methods as in the group project.

- **Event Listings:** Displays a comprehensive list of events sourced from the external API.

- **Event Details:** Users can view detailed information about each event, including date, time, location, and descriptions on dedicated event pages.

- **Event Registration:** Users can register for events if there are available spots, ensuring quick and easy booking.

- **Fully Booked Indicator:** Events that have reached capacity are clearly marked, preventing further registrations.

- **Cancel Registration:** If a user changes their mind, they can cancel their registration for an event.

- **Sorting and Filtering:** Events can be sorted by date and location, while past events are automatically hidden.
